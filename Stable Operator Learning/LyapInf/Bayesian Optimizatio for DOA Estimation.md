# Bayesian Optimization for Domain of Attraction Estimation

Estimating the domain of attraction (DoA) can be framed as a **Bayesian optimization (BO)** problem despite the unknown dynamics. We have a Lyapunov function $V(x)$ (smooth, $V(x)>0$ for $x\neq0$, $V(0)=0$) that decreases along trajectories ($\dot V(x) < 0$ in the region of attraction). The goal is to find the largest level-set $c$ such that $V(x)\leq c$ is within the DoA – equivalently, find points on the boundary where $\dot V(x)=0$. In practice, we want to **maximize the “safe” level $c$** (or minimize $V(x)$ for a boundary point) subject to the constraint that $\dot V(x)$ is zero (or changes sign) at that boundary.

Because the dynamics $f(x)$ are unknown, we cannot compute $\dot V(x)=\nabla V(x)^T f(x)$ analytically. Instead, we use data (state trajectories and sampled $\dot x$) to model $\dot V(x)$ and then apply BO to find the boundary. The following outlines a methodology using state-of-the-art BO techniques:

## Modeling $\dot V(x)$ from Data

**1. Estimating $\dot V(x)$:** Given trajectory data, for each sampled state $x$ we can compute an _approximate_ $\dot V(x)$ by evaluating $\nabla V(x)^T \dot x$. (Since $V(x)$ is known and smooth, $\nabla V(x)$ is computable. $\dot x$ comes from either numerical differentiation of trajectories or direct measurements; it will be noisy.) This gives a set of input-output pairs ${x_i, \dot V_i}_{i=1}^N$. We treat the unknown mapping $g(x)=\dot V(x)$ as a _black-box function_ to be learned.

**2. Surrogate model (Gaussian Process):** We can place a Gaussian Process (GP) prior on $g(x)=\nabla V(x)^T f(x)$ to model it across $\mathbb{R}^n$. GPs are a common choice in BO because they provide a posterior mean and uncertainty estimate for any query point [Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=systems%20from%20data%20has%20been,to%20compute%20robust%20invariant%20sets)). The Lipschitz assumption on $f(x)$ (and smooth $V$) suggests $g(x)$ is a _smooth function_, which aligns with using a GP with a smooth kernel (e.g. RBF kernel encodes Lipschitz continuity). The GP is fit to the data ${x_i, \dot V_i}$, yielding an approximate model $\hat g(x)$ of $\dot V(x)$ with uncertainty bands. This surrogate can predict $\dot V(x)$ at new, untried states and quantify uncertainty due to sparse or noisy data.

_Alternative:_ Instead of modeling $\dot V(x)$ directly as a scalar GP, one can model the **vector field** $f(x)$ with a multi-output GP and then compute $\dot V(x)$ from it. This uses the relationship $\dot V(x)=\nabla V(x)^T f(x)$: by modeling $f(x)$, we can derive $\dot V(x)$ (which will also be Gaussian since it’s a linear combination of GP outputs). The multi-output GP approach can incorporate the known structure in $f$ (if any) and exploit correlations between different state dimensions ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=dimensions%2C%20at%20the%20expense%20of,2Bg%20%2B%20300%CE%B3%200)). However, it is often simpler and effective to model the scalar function $\dot V(x)$ directly, since we ultimately care about its zero level set.

**3. Noise and error modeling:** The measurements of $\dot V(x)$ are approximate (due to estimating $\dot x$ from data). We incorporate this by treating observations as noisy: $y_i = \dot V(x_i) + \epsilon_i$. The GP can account for a noise variance. In practice, if the noise is small or one can directly measure $\dot x$ with good accuracy, the GP model will mostly capture model uncertainty (due to sparsity of data) rather than measurement noise.

## BO Problem Formulation: Objective and Constraints

With a surrogate for $\dot V(x)$ in place, we set up a **constrained optimization** to find the DoA boundary. The optimization problem can be stated as:

- **Objective:** find the state $x$ (on the boundary) that _minimizes_ $V(x)$ (thus giving the smallest $V$-level on the boundary). Equivalently, one can frame it as maximizing the level $c = V(x)$. In other words, we seek the largest level-set $c$ such that $V(x)\le c$ remains inside the domain of attraction. Because $V(x)$ increases as we go outward from the equilibrium, the “smallest $V$ on the boundary” (excluding the trivial minimum at $x=0$) corresponds to the _largest safe level_ $c_*$. In practice it is more intuitive to **maximize $V(x)$** subject to safety, and the solution will satisfy $\dot V(x)=0$. We will use that formulation.

- **Constraint:** $\dot V(x) = 0$ for points on the boundary. Since requiring an exact zero is not robust (and $x=0$ is a trivial solution with $V=0$), we relax this to finding states where $\dot V(x)$ _crosses from negative to non-negative_. Essentially, we require $\dot V(x)\le 0$ (for safety) and identify points where $\dot V(x)$ is _approximately zero_ (the boundary where it stops being strictly negative). In practice, we handle this with an inequality constraint $\dot V(x)\le 0$ and expect the optimum to occur when $\dot V(x)\approx 0$. All states well inside the DoA satisfy $\dot V(x)<0$; the boundary is reached when $\dot V(x)$ approaches 0 from below ([Zhai and Nguyen](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/llustration-on-the-level-set-of-Lyapunov-function-The-red-ellipse-describes-the-level_fig1_333668004#:~:text=the%20level%20set%20,0)). Thus the feasible region in optimization is ${x: \dot V(x) < 0}$, and we seek the furthest $x$ in this region (in terms of $V$ value).

Formally, the **Bayesian optimization** problem becomes:

$$
\max_{x} \; V(x) \quad \text{s.t.} \;\; g(x) = \dot V(x) \le 0.
$$

This is a constrained black-box optimization – $V(x)$ is known and cheap to evaluate (since $V$ is given analytically), but the constraint $g(x)\le 0$ involves the unknown function $g(x)=\dot V(x)$ which we only know via our GP model. We cannot simply enumerate all $x$, so we will use BO to intelligently sample points and satisfy the constraint.

**Surrogate models:** We maintain two models:

- A deterministic model for the objective $V(x)$ (we can compute $V(x)$ exactly for any $x$).
- The GP model for the constraint $g(x)=\dot V(x)$.

**Acquisition function with constraint:** In constrained BO, acquisitions are designed to prefer points that **improve the objective _and_ are likely feasible**. A common choice is the _Expected Improvement_ (EI) modified by feasibility probability. For example, one can use **Constrained Expected Improvement (CEI)** which multiplies the usual EI by the probability of satisfying the constraint. This means the BO algorithm will favor points that both have low $V(x)$ (potentially expanding the domain) and have a high probability that $\dot V(x)\le 0$ (satisfy stability) ([Gelbart et al.](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/pdfs/gelbart2014constraints.pdf#:~:text=Bayesian%20optimization%20problems%20can%20be,Section%203)).

Alternatively, we can treat this as a **feasible set search** problem: at each iteration, find the point that maximizes $V(x)$ among those that are _probably safe_. “Probably safe” can be defined as $P(\dot V(x)\le 0)$ above some threshold (e.g. 95% probability) ([Gelbart et al.](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/pdfs/gelbart2014constraints.pdf#:~:text=the%20constraint%20be%20satisfied%20with,minimum%20confidence%201%20%E2%88%92%20%CE%B4)). This probabilistic constraint ensures with high confidence that we do not sample an unsafe point. Initially, our model might be uncertain, so we start with a conservative feasible set.

**In summary:** The BO loop will iteratively:

1. Use the GP posterior to estimate the feasibility of candidate states (constraint satisfaction).
2. Select a next query $x_{next}$ that maximizes an acquisition function (e.g. expected improvement on $V$) _while weighted by the probability_ that $\dot V(x_{next})\le 0$ (feasible).
3. Sample the system at $x_{next}$ – e.g. run a simulation or an experiment to estimate $\dot V(x_{next})$ – without actually leaving the safe region.
4. Update the GP model with the new data and repeat.

Because $V(x)$ is known and not expensive, the challenge is mainly handling the constraint. This formulation turns our problem into a **Bayesian global optimization under unknown constraint**, a well-studied scenario ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=In%20our%20method%2C%20we%20use,we%20combine%20ideas%20from%20GP)). Notably, Berkenkamp _et al._ (2016) combined GP models with Lyapunov-based constraints in a similar way ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=In%20our%20method%2C%20we%20use,we%20combine%20ideas%20from%20GP)).

## Handling Constraint Uncertainty and Safety

A critical aspect is that our constraint ($\dot V(x)\le0$) is modeled, not known exactly. We must account for uncertainty to avoid sampling outside the true domain of attraction (which could lead to instability in a real system). State-of-the-art techniques to handle this include:

- **High-probability safety constraints:** As mentioned, require $P(\dot V(x)\le0) \ge 1-\delta$ for some confidence $1-\delta$ (e.g. 0.95) when selecting $x$ ([Gelbart et al.](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/pdfs/gelbart2014constraints.pdf#:~:text=the%20constraint%20be%20satisfied%20with,minimum%20confidence%201%20%E2%88%92%20%CE%B4)). This ensures we only pick points that are very likely to be safe according to our current model. Initially, this will restrict us to a small region around the equilibrium where we are sure $\dot V<0$ (e.g. we might start with a small $c_0$ such that $V(x)\le c_0$ is known to be safe by prior knowledge).
    
- **“Safe Bayesian Optimization” methods:** Algorithms like **SafeOpt** (Safe Optimization) maintain and expand a **safe set** iteratively ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=consists%20only%20of%20the%20initial,to%20the%20largest%20safe%20level)). They start from an initial safe state and only evaluate the system at new states that are predicted to be safe (under the GP model with confidence bounds). SafeOpt uses the GP’s upper confidence bound (UCB) on $\dot V(x)$ to conservatively estimate where $\dot V$ could still be $\le 0$ with high probability ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=have%20from%20,At%20that%20point)). It then picks the feasible state that maximizes $V(x)$ (to expand the region) or that reduces uncertainty on the boundary. This way, the algorithm **never samples a state that is likely unsafe**, ensuring all experiments keep the system within the true RoA with high probability ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=Fig.%201.%20One,level%20sets%20of%20the%20Lyapunov)). Over iterations, the safe set expands outward (if data confirms those outer states are still safe) ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=consists%20only%20of%20the%20initial,to%20the%20largest%20safe%20level)). This process continues until no further expansion is possible without violating safety, at which point the largest safe level-set has been found (to within some tolerance).
    
- **Relaxation of equality constraint:** Instead of looking for exact $\dot V = 0$, we impose $\dot V(x) \le -\epsilon$ for interior points and consider the boundary found when $\dot V$ approaches $0$. In practice, one introduces a small safety margin. For example, Berkenkamp _et al._ choose a margin $-!L \tau < 0$ (where $L$ is a Lipschitz constant of $\dot V$) – they require $\dot V(x)\le -L\tau$ for points to be considered safely inside, which ensures a buffer ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=states%20with%20V%CB%99%20,equilibrium%20point%2C%20where%20additionally%20friction)). Only when the model is confident that $\dot V(x)$ is below this negative threshold is $x$ declared safe. This avoids sampling points that might have $\dot V$ slightly positive due to model error. As the model improves (or $\tau$ is reduced), this margin can be relaxed to approach the true boundary. Using a strict negative threshold for safety leads to a **conservative estimate** of the DoA (underestimating it initially), but it guarantees safety despite uncertainty ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=states%20with%20V%CB%99%20,equilibrium%20point%2C%20where%20additionally%20friction)). We can shrink this threshold as confidence improves, gradually approaching $\dot V=0$ from the safe side.
    
- **Incorporating Lipschitz knowledge:** If we know a Lipschitz constant for $g(x)=\dot V(x)$, we can use it to further guard against uncertainty. For instance, given an uncertain GP estimate at some point, one can use Lipschitz bounds to infer a region around a known safe point that is also safe. This can guide safe expansion without direct sampling of every point. (In fact, some algorithms discretize the state space and use Lipschitz + GP uncertainty to mark entire regions as safe ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=evaluating%20states%20close%20to%20the,0%20only%20requires)).)

In summary, we treat the constraint carefully by _only sampling where the model strongly predicts $\dot V(x)\le0$_. This cautious approach ensures we _never leave the region of attraction during exploration_ (important for safety-critical systems). Over time, as we gather more data, the GP’s uncertainty shrinks and we can approach the true boundary more closely. Eventually, the algorithm converges to an estimate of the largest safe level-set with high confidence ([Gelbart et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L649%20stronger%20result%3A,the%20ROA%20estimate%20using%20the)).

## Scaling to High Dimensions

Bayesian optimization and GP modeling become more challenging as the state dimension $n$ grows (10, 100, or more). High-dimensional BO is an active research area, and several techniques can help in this context:

- **Sparse Gaussian Processes:** For very high-dimensional $x$ or large data, standard GP inference ($O(N^3)$) is expensive. Sparse GP techniques introduce a smaller set of **inducing points** to reduce complexity. Methods like FITC, SVGP, and other inducing-point approaches approximate the full GP with a manageable number of parameters. In our setting, as we accumulate sampling data, a sparse GP can keep computations tractable. (One might start with a modest number of inducing points and add more as needed.) These approximations let us handle more data points and moderate dimensions at the cost of a slight loss in accuracy. Since $n=100$+ is quite large for a naive GP, sparse approximations or semi-parametric models become practically necessary.
  
- **Dimensionality reduction (low intrinsic dimension):** Often, even if $x\in \mathbb{R}^{100}$, the function $\dot V(x)$ might actually vary primarily along a few directions (due to the structure of $V$ or the dynamics). If we suspect a lower **effective dimensionality** $d \ll n$, we can leverage **random embeddings** or subspace methods. For example, the REMBO algorithm projects high-dimensional points onto a random $d$-dimensional subspace to perform BO ([Wang et al.](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/wp-content/uploads/papers/16-JAIR-REMBO.pdf#:~:text=Matheson%2C%20%26%20de%20Freitas%2C%202013,Importantly)). The idea is that with a sufficiently “rich” random projection, the optimum (largest $V$ on the boundary) can be found in some low-$d$ linear subspace with high probability ([Wang et al.](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/wp-content/uploads/papers/16-JAIR-REMBO.pdf#:~:text=Bayesian%20optimization%20variant%20based%20on,only%20has%20d%20%3D%201)). By optimizing over that subspace (which is tractable for GPs when $d$ is small), we can find a candidate and then map it back to the original space. If multiple random projections are tried, one can cover the space with confidence ([Wang et al.](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/wp-content/uploads/papers/16-JAIR-REMBO.pdf#:~:text=drawn%20random%20embeddings,considered%20space%20of%20k%20independently)). More recent improvements (like HeSBO, embedding via hashing/sketching, or learned embeddings) also aim to handle high $n$ by effectively reducing dimensionality during optimization.
  
- **Automatic relevance determination (ARD):** When fitting the GP, use a kernel with separate lengthscale hyperparameters for each input dimension. This can automatically detect irrelevant dimensions (by giving them very large lengthscales, i.e., $g(x)$ does not change along those directions). In practice, ARD can sometimes help focus the model on the true degrees of freedom. However, in very high dims and limited data, ARD is hard to estimate reliably. Recent Bayesian approaches (like the SAAS GP – Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace GP) put priors to encourage most dimensions to be irrelevant, effectively discovering a low-dimensional subspace of importance ([Eriksson and Jankowiak](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v161/eriksson21a/eriksson21a.pdf#:~:text=GP,design%20problem%20we%20use%20100)). This can be applied if we have reason to believe $\dot V(x)$ depends on only a few state features.
  
- **Trust-region Bayesian optimization:** Instead of trying to model a 100-dimensional function globally, **TuRBO** (Trust Region BO) takes a _local_ approach. It runs multiple local BO optimizers on subsets of the space, each within a hyperrectangle “trust region” around the current best solutions ([Eriksson et al.](http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/8788-scalable-global-optimization-via-local-bayesian-optimization.pdf#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20TuRBO%20maintains%20m%20trust,rise%20to%20a%20classical%20exploitation)). Each trust region uses its own GP model, which is easier since within a local region the function behaves more predictably and effective dimensionality may be lower. After each batch of evaluations, trust regions expand if the model is making good progress, or shrink if not, and new regions are initiated from random restarts to cover other parts of space ([Eriksson et al.](http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/8788-scalable-global-optimization-via-local-bayesian-optimization.pdf#:~:text=Trust%20regions,far%2C%20denoted%20by%20x)). This method has been shown to outperform global high-d BO in many cases, as it avoids the curse of dimensionality by focusing on promising areas. For our problem, a trust-region method could start near the origin (small $V$) and gradually move outward, spawning new local searches in different “directions” of state space to find the farthest safe point. TuRBO’s use of multiple GPs in parallel and aggressive local search helps scaling to 100+ dimensions.
  
- **Batch and parallel evaluations:** High-dimensional searches often benefit from evaluating multiple candidates in parallel (to gather more information per iteration). If we have the ability to simulate or experiment with several states concurrently, modern BO frameworks allow selecting a batch of points per iteration (e.g. by maximizing a batch acquisition or via Thompson sampling on the GP posterior). This can speed up convergence, especially in high-d problems where each iteration is expensive.


In practice, a combination of these strategies might be used. For instance, one could use a sparse GP with ARD kernel for the constraint model, and employ a trust-region optimizer to propose new samples. If we suspect only a subset of state variables strongly influence stability, we might apply dimensionality reduction techniques as well. These techniques ensure that our approach remains **computationally feasible** even as state dimension grows.

## Active Learning to Discover the DoA Boundary

When data is limited, an **active learning strategy** can greatly improve sample efficiency – i.e. require fewer trajectory simulations or experiments to pinpoint the domain boundary. In the BO loop, this is handled by the acquisition function’s behavior, but we can describe it in intuitive terms:

- **Focus on the boundary (uncertain region):** Initially, we know the system is safe near $x=0$ (stable equilibrium) and unsafe very far away (where $V(x)$ is very large or the system diverges). The crucial information lies at the boundary between safe and unsafe. Thus, the algorithm should focus sampling in regions where $\dot V(x)$ is _expected to be near 0_ or where the GP model is uncertain about the sign of $\dot V(x)$. By querying those points, we quickly reduce uncertainty about whether they belong to the DoA. This concept is similar to **level set estimation via active learning**, where one seeks the points that most reduce uncertainty about the level-set ${x: g(x)=0}$ ([Gotovos et al.](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/13/Papers/202.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L353%20Figure%201b%29,LSE%20by%20choosing%20to%20evaluate)). For example, the LSE (Level Set Estimation) algorithm explicitly chooses points with the largest classification ambiguity (neither clearly safe nor unsafe) to sample, which efficiently learns the boundary ([Gotovos et al.](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/13/Papers/202.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L353%20Figure%201b%29,LSE%20by%20choosing%20to%20evaluate)).
  
- **Safe expansion:** The safe-opt algorithm described earlier inherently does active learning on the boundary. It maintains the current _safe set_ and a _candidate frontier_ of points at the edge of this set that could potentially be safe. In each iteration, it picks either:
  
    - a _greedy expansion point_ (the one with the highest $V$ among the frontier, which if safe would expand the domain the most), or
    - an _uncertainty reduction point_ (one that maximally reduces GP uncertainty on $\dot V$ at the boundary).
    
    This balances **exploration and exploitation**: sometimes you test a point with slightly higher $V$ to see if the domain can be extended, other times you test a point to refine the model. By doing so, the algorithm **actively learns the shape of the DoA boundary** without venturing out unsafely ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=evaluating%20states%20close%20to%20the,0%20only%20requires)).

- **Efficiency considerations:** Because each experiment might be costly (e.g. simulating a long trajectory or risking an unstable run), we want to get the most information per sample. Using the GP’s confidence intervals is helpful: for instance, we might choose the point where the GP **uncertainty interval for $\dot V$ straddles 0** (meaning it could be either safe or unsafe). Sampling that point will tell us a lot about the location of the boundary. If the result shows $\dot V<0$, we gained a new safe region; if $\dot V\ge0$, we identified part of the boundary. In either case, future samples can focus elsewhere, thereby converging faster. This targeted sampling is far more efficient than, say, random sampling or a grid search in high dimensions.
  
- **Active learning with Lyapunov knowledge:** Since we know $V(x)$, we can also guide sampling by $V$ values. For example, we might increase $V$ gradually: first find if the level-set $V(x)\le c_1$ is safe, then try a slightly higher $c_2$, and so on – a bit like a **bisection** on the value of $c$. This is essentially performing a line search on the level $c$, which is a classic approach in Lyapunov-based ROA estimation (and in fact, with known dynamics one would increase $c$ until $\dot V$ fails to be negative) ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=Given%20a%20Lyapunov%20function%2C%20the,6%5D%20considered)). In the BO context, we don’t increase $c$ linearly, but the algorithm’s selection of points tends to progressively push outward in $V$. It might jump around in different “directions” in state-space, but always roughly at the largest safe $V$ found so far. This is analogous to how **contour-finding algorithms** work: they trace out the boundary by always probing a bit beyond the known safe region.
  
- **Batch exploration on the boundary:** If parallel experiments are possible, one strategy is to sample multiple points _along the predicted boundary_ simultaneously. For instance, the GP model might indicate a ring or surface where $\dot V(x)\approx 0$ with uncertainty. We could pick a diverse set of points on that surface to evaluate in parallel. This can rapidly map out a section of the boundary. After observing the outcomes, the GP is updated and the boundary estimate is refined.
  

By following these strategies, the BO procedure **efficiently “feels out” the edges of the domain of attraction**. The use of GP uncertainty ensures we target the unknown areas, and the Lyapunov function structure provides additional guidance (since we know $V$ generally increases outward, the worst-case boundary likely lies at higher $V$ values). In practice, Berkenkamp _et al._ report that focusing sampling near the estimated boundary greatly improves data-efficiency without sacrificing safety ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=Algorithm%201%20can%20be%20made,0%20only%20requires)). Their algorithm was able to find the ROA with far fewer experiments by **not wasting samples deep inside the safe region or far outside it**, but instead honing in on where $\dot V(x)$ transitions to non-negative.

## Summary

In summary, to estimate the domain of attraction with unknown dynamics, we:

- **Use a GP surrogate to model** the Lyapunov derivative $\dot V(x)$ from trajectory data ([](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=systems%20from%20data%20has%20been,to%20compute%20robust%20invariant%20sets)). This provides predictions and uncertainty for any state.
- **Set up a constrained BO**: maximize $V(x)$ subject to $\dot V(x)\le 0$. The GP model of $\dot V$ is used to enforce the constraint probabilistically ([Gelbart et al.](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/pdfs/gelbart2014constraints.pdf#:~:text=Bayesian%20optimization%20problems%20can%20be,Section%203)). The largest $V$ found under this constraint gives the estimated $c_*$. This corresponds to the largest level-set inside which $V$ decreases (our DoA estimate).
- **Incorporate uncertainty for safety**: Only sample points that are likely (with high confidence) to satisfy $\dot V(x)<0$ to avoid leaving the true DoA during experiments ([Gelbart et al.](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/pdfs/gelbart2014constraints.pdf#:~:text=the%20constraint%20be%20satisfied%20with,minimum%20confidence%201%20%E2%88%92%20%CE%B4)). Algorithms like SafeOpt ensure all sampled states remain safe with high probability ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=Fig.%201.%20One,level%20sets%20of%20the%20Lyapunov)). A safety margin (e.g. requiring $\dot V < -\varepsilon$) makes the estimate conservative but safe ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=states%20with%20V%CB%99%20,equilibrium%20point%2C%20where%20additionally%20friction)).
- **Scale up the GP and BO**: Apply sparse GP models and dimensionality reduction to handle high-dimensional states. Techniques like random embeddings ([Wang et al.](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/wp-content/uploads/papers/16-JAIR-REMBO.pdf#:~:text=Matheson%2C%20%26%20de%20Freitas%2C%202013,Importantly)) and trust-region BO ([Eriksson et al.](http://papers.neurips.cc/paper/8788-scalable-global-optimization-via-local-bayesian-optimization.pdf#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20TuRBO%20maintains%20m%20trust,rise%20to%20a%20classical%20exploitation)) help search efficiently in 100+ dimensions by reducing the effective search space or splitting it into manageable pieces.
- **Actively explore the boundary**: Guide the sampling to points where $\dot V(x)$ is near the boundary between negative and positive. By focusing on these uncertain boundary regions ([Gotovos et al.](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/13/Papers/202.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L353%20Figure%201b%29,LSE%20by%20choosing%20to%20evaluate)), the BO procedure learns the extent of the attraction domain with far fewer samples than naive strategies. The safe set is expanded iteratively until no further expansion is possible without violating the $\dot V<0$ condition ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=consists%20only%20of%20the%20initial,to%20the%20largest%20safe%20level)).

Using this approach, one can systematically and safely approximate the region of attraction. The result is an estimate of $c$ (and the corresponding level-set $V(x)\le c$) that with high probability is a subset of the true DoA. As more data is collected (or if the process is allowed to continue indefinitely in simulation), this estimate can approach the true maximum DoA. This BO-driven method leverages modern techniques in Bayesian learning and optimization to tackle a challenging control problem – providing a practical and theoretically grounded way to estimate stability regions **without an analytical model of the dynamics**, and doing so efficiently and safely ([Berkenkamp et al.](https://www.dynsyslab.org/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/berkenkamp-cdc16.pdf#:~:text=consists%20only%20of%20the%20initial,to%20the%20largest%20safe%20level)).
