# LyapInf for PDEs

## Todos
- [ ] Start testing on the viscous Burgers' equation (make sure to change the data because the training data for the OpInf experiments is not a good dataset for the LyapInf example probably) ðŸ“… 2025-01-06
- [ ] Come up with a more scalable formulation of the convex optimization approach to compute the estimated domain of attraction for the inferred Lyapunov function ðŸ“… 2025-01-06 
- [ ] Test on other examples
