Yes, at least in principle, covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) can be integrated into a projection-based model reduction framework, though doing so is neither straightforward nor commonly practiced. Here’s why and how they might be considered:

1. **What Covariant Lyapunov Vectors Represent:**  
    CLVs provide a state-dependent decomposition of the system’s tangent space into directions of growth or decay. They are associated with the Lyapunov spectrum and characterize how perturbations evolve in time. Unlike classical Lyapunov vectors that are tied to forward or backward limits only, CLVs are “covariant” in the sense that they respect the underlying dynamics’ smooth conjugacies and intrinsic directions of instability, stability, and neutral growth. They form a basis of the tangent space that reveals the system’s fundamental dynamic structures, such as stable, unstable, and center manifolds.
    
2. **Projection-Based Model Reduction Basics:**  
    Typical projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) are constructed using bases derived from data or system realizations (e.g., Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), balanced truncation, or Krylov subspace methods). These bases aim to capture the dominant energy-containing or input-output relevant features of the system. The system is then projected onto this reduced subspace to produce a simplified dynamical model with fewer degrees of freedom.
    
3. **Potential Advantages of Using CLVs:**
    
    - **Dynamic Relevance:** Since CLVs directly reflect the directions in which trajectories expand or contract, using them as a basis for model reduction might produce a reduced model that intrinsically respects the system’s stability structure.
    - **Capturing Nonlinear Instabilities:** For strongly nonlinear or chaotic systems, POD modes might fail to capture the essential directions of instability. CLVs, on the other hand, are designed to highlight these directions and could theoretically yield a reduced model that better predicts long-term behavior, especially in systems dominated by delicate stability properties or chaos.
    - **Time-Variability:** CLVs vary with the system’s state, reflecting local stability characteristics. In principle, this could yield a time-dependent reduction basis that adapts to the system’s current regime—something that static bases like POD cannot do unless you adopt a more complex adaptive or online approach.
4. **Challenges and Practical Considerations:**
    
    - **Computational Expense:** Computing CLVs is nontrivial. It generally involves substantial numerical effort, such as forward and backward integrations of the tangent linear model and sophisticated alignment procedures. Incorporating them into a reduction pipeline might be computationally intensive.
    - **Basis Management:** Since CLVs depend on the point along the trajectory, the reduced basis might need to be updated as the solution evolves. This leads to a time-dependent projection space (akin to methods that use local bases or manifold-based reduction), complicating the implementation.
    - **Loss of Standard Orthogonality and Efficiency:** Unlike POD modes, CLVs are typically neither orthogonal nor normalized in a manner convenient for standard Galerkin projections. Working with them might require additional steps to ensure well-conditioned reduced operators.
5. **Potential Hybrid Approaches:**  
    One might consider combining CLVs with more conventional methods: for example, using CLVs to identify key directions of instability or slow subspaces and then complementing them with POD modes or balancing modes for the remaining dynamics. Another approach might be to construct piecewise or parameterized reduced models that embed CLVs in regimes where their added value is most pronounced.
    

**In Summary:**  
While not a standard approach, using covariant Lyapunov vectors for projection-based model reduction is conceptually appealing, especially for complex, nonlinear, and possibly chaotic systems. The direct link between CLVs and the system’s intrinsic stability directions could, in theory, yield more dynamically relevant reduced models. However, the computational and conceptual hurdles are significant, and practical implementations remain rare and challenging.

“Standard Lyapunov vectors” generally refer to the forward or backward Lyapunov vectors obtained through the traditional procedure for computing Lyapunov exponents. They emerge from analyzing how perturbations to a trajectory grow or decay over time, but their computation is carried out in only one time direction—either entirely forward or entirely backward in time.

Here’s how they are typically obtained:

1. **Forward Lyapunov Vectors:**  
    By repeatedly integrating the linearized dynamics forward in time and regularly re-orthonormalizing the resulting set of perturbation vectors, one obtains a set of directions that highlight where perturbations tend to grow. Over many steps, these directions converge toward the eigenbasis associated with the largest (dominant) Lyapunov exponents. The resulting set of vectors represents how infinitesimal perturbations evolve when looking forward from the present into the future.
    
2. **Backward Lyapunov Vectors:**  
    Similarly, by integrating the linearized dynamics backward in time and performing analogous orthonormalizations, one obtains vectors that reflect how perturbations behaved when tracing the trajectory from the future back to the present. These give stable directions—directions along which perturbations shrink as one moves forward in time, since integrating backward reverses that perspective.
    

Because these “standard” Lyapunov vectors are computed strictly in one time direction (forward or backward), each set is tied to that perspective. Forward Lyapunov vectors depend on future evolution, while backward Lyapunov vectors depend on past evolution. As a result, they do not provide a fully time-localized, intrinsic characterization of stability directions at a given point. Instead, they reflect a mixture of local and global features—e.g., forward vectors show the directions of strongest long-term growth, but they are influenced by the entire future trajectory.

In contrast, **covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs)** are computed using both forward and backward procedures. CLVs result in a set of basis vectors that are truly local to each point along the trajectory and remain consistent with the system’s dynamics from one point to the next. This makes CLVs “covariant” under the system’s evolution and better suited for characterizing the local stability properties in a dynamic, state-dependent manner.

Dealing with the inherent non-orthogonality of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) is challenging because their defining property—that they remain aligned with the system’s stable and unstable manifolds at each point—does not naturally lend itself to forming an orthogonal set. Nonetheless, there are a few strategies and considerations that can help mitigate issues arising from non-orthogonality:

1. **Post-Processing for Numerical Stability:**  
    After computing CLVs, one can apply an orthogonalization procedure (e.g., Gram–Schmidt, QR factorization) to the resulting set of vectors. This step would generate an orthonormal basis spanning the same subspace as the CLVs. Although you lose the direct dynamic interpretation of each original vector, this approach ensures better numerical conditioning and stability in subsequent computations.
    
2. **Weighted Inner Products:**  
    Sometimes, using a non-standard inner product or a weighting matrix can improve the conditioning of the projection. By carefully choosing an inner product that emphasizes certain directions or normalizes certain state variables, you might achieve an effectively more orthogonal set of vectors while preserving useful dynamic information.
    
3. **Piecewise or Local Orthogonalization:**  
    Instead of forcing orthogonality globally, you could perform localized orthogonalization steps at discrete time intervals. By preserving the covariant property between these intervals and only orthogonalizing within smaller neighborhoods, you might strike a balance between maintaining the dynamical relevance of the CLVs and ensuring that your computations don’t become ill-conditioned.
    
4. **Hybrid Bases:**  
    In some scenarios, you could use CLVs as a guide to identify the most dynamically relevant directions and then augment or replace these directions with a well-conditioned basis derived from standard techniques like POD or balanced truncation. For instance, you might identify which CLVs capture key stability features, and then use them as a starting point to build a stable, orthonormal basis that approximates those crucial directions.
    
5. **Regularization Techniques:**  
    If the direct use of CLVs leads to ill-conditioning, numerical issues, or poor ROM performance due to non-orthogonality, introducing regularization techniques—such as small perturbations to the vectors or filtering out components associated with extremely similar or nearly collinear vectors—can help stabilize computations.
    

**In short:** While CLVs are inherently non-orthogonal due to their construction and purpose, you can employ standard linear algebra tools, alternative inner products, local orthogonalizations, hybrid strategies, and regularization techniques to tame their non-orthogonality. The chosen method depends on the specific application, computational constraints, and how important it is to preserve the exact dynamical interpretation of the CLVs.
